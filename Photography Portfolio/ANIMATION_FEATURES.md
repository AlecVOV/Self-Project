# ‚ú® Smooth Animations & Micro-Interactions Implementation

This document outlines all the smooth animations and micro-interactions that have been implemented across your photography portfolio to create a polished, professional user experience.

## üéØ Animation Framework

### **Vue Use Motion**
- **Library**: `@vueuse/motion` - Already configured in your project
- **Purpose**: Provides powerful entrance animations, scroll-triggered animations, and gesture-based interactions
- **Configuration**: Auto-imported and ready to use with `v-motion` directive

### **Enhanced CSS Animations**
- **Custom keyframes** for floating, pulse-glow, shimmer, and text-reveal effects
- **Cubic-bezier easing** functions for natural, smooth transitions
- **Hardware acceleration** optimization for better performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced CSS Utilities

### **New Animation Classes:**
```css
.btn              # Enhanced buttons with hover effects
.card             # Lift and scale hover animations
.float            # Floating animation for elements
.pulse-glow       # Pulsing glow effect for CTAs
.nav-link         # Navigation links with underline animation
.loading-shimmer  # Loading state animations
.text-reveal      # Text reveal effects
```

### **Transition Improvements:**
- **Smooth cubic-bezier easing** for natural motion
- **Hardware acceleration** optimization
- **Reduced motion support** for accessibility
- **Stagger utilities** for sequential animations

### **Micro-Interactions:**
- **Button shine effects** with pseudo-elements
- **Image hover transformations** with multiple properties
- **Text slide animations** with staggered delays
- **Icon rotation and scale** effects

## üé≠ Animation Patterns Used

### **1. Entrance Animations**
- **Fade + Slide**: Elements appear with opacity and position changes
- **Scale + Fade**: Elements grow in with scaling effect
- **Staggered Timing**: Sequential delays for grid items

### **2. Hover States**
- **Lift Effect**: Elements raise up with shadow
- **Scale Transform**: Subtle size increases
- **Color Transitions**: Smooth color changes
- **Multi-property**: Combining multiple effects

### **3. Page Transitions**
- **Enhanced page transitions** with scale and opacity
- **Smooth route changes** with cubic-bezier easing
- **Loading states** with shimmer effects

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### **Hardware Acceleration:**
- `transform` properties trigger GPU acceleration
- `will-change` hints for browsers
- Optimized animation properties

### **Reduced Motion:**
- Media query support for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Graceful degradation for accessibility
- Animation duration controls

### **Lazy Loading:**
- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- `visibleOnce` directive for one-time animations
- Efficient animation cleanup
