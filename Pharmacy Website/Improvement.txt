Looking at your Nuxt 3 pharmacy e-commerce project, I can see it's well-structured with many components already in place. However, there are several key areas that appear to be missing or need attention:

Critical Missing Components
1. Store Management (Pinia)
The project has Pinia configured but the stores directory seems incomplete:
Only useCartStore is referenced
Missing user authentication store
Missing product catalog store
Missing order management store


2. Authentication System
No authentication pages or composables are visible:
Login/Register pages
Password reset functionality
User session management
Protected routes middleware


3. Product Management
Product listing pages
Product detail pages
Product search functionality
Category management
Inventory management


4. Payment Integration
While checkout.vue exists, it appears to be missing:

Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
Payment processing logic
Payment success/failure handling
5. Backend API Integration
No API routes in the server directory
Missing database integration
No real data fetching composables
All data appears to be mock/sample data


6. User Account Management
Referenced in navigation but missing:

User profile management
Order history
Prescription management
Address book
Account settings
7. Search Functionality
The SiteHeader.vue has a search input but no actual search implementation.

8. Additional Missing Pages
Based on the navigation and links, these pages are missing:

/products - Product catalog
/categories - Product categories
/prescriptions - Prescription management
/account/* - User account pages
/login and /register - Authentication pages

Recommended Next Steps
Set up stores for state management:
// stores/auth.js
// stores/products.js
// stores/orders.js


Create authentication system:
// pages/login.vue
// pages/register.vue
// middleware/auth.js


Implement product catalog:
// pages/products/index.vue
// pages/products/[slug].vue


Add API routes:
// server/api/auth/login.post.js
// server/api/products/index.get.js
// server/api/orders/index.post.js


Complete the checkout process with real payment integration



The foundation is solid with good component structure and styling. The main gap is transitioning from static/demo content to a fully functional e-commerce platform with real data persistence and user management.
Add proper error handling and loading states throughout the application
