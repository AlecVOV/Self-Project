Reconnaise.ai is a project by the student team G2 `Motor_Ola` for the Swinburne unit COS30049, in which we present an AI chatbot application used for the detection of software vulnerabilities.

The work is organised as follow:

- `/api/backend`: AI datasets and model for Assignment 2
- `/frontend`: React frontend for Assignment 3
- `/api`: FastAPI for Assignment 3

Documentation for setting up and using the application are included in the [api](./api/README.md) and [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directories. It is recommended to start-up the backend/API first and the frontend later.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, BeerCSS
