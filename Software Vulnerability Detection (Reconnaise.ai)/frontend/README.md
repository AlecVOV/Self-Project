# Reconnaise.ai Frontend

This portion consists of a React application that fetches data from the [API](../api/README.md).

## Setup

In a terminal working in this directory, run `npm i` to install application dependencies

## Run

- Run `npm run dev` to start the development version of the application, with hot code reloading and support for browser devtool enabled.
- Run `npm run build` to compile a production-grade version. The resulted code is available in the `dist` directory, which is hostable via a simple web server or `npm run preview`.
