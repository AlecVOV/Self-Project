## Overview

This project is a fully functional **Snake** game implemented in Python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) library. It includes:

- A straightforward **GameEngine** to manage the main loop and states of the game (menu, playing, paused, and game over).
- A **Snake** entity that can grow, move, and collide with itself or obstacles.
- Randomly generated **Food** and **Obstacles**.
- A **ScoreManager** that keeps track of the player's current score and updates a leaderboard.
- A simple **UI** for drawing menus, scores, and the game-over screen.
- Utility functions for random position generation, collision detection, and saving/loading high scores.

---

## Features

1. **Menu Screen**  
   - Press **SPACE** to start the game.  
   - Press **Q** to quit from the menu screen.

2. **Snake Movement & Growth**  
   - Move the snake in four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  
   - The snake grows when it eats food.

3. **Food & Obstacles**  
   - Food spawns in random locations.  
   - Obstacles are randomly placed; the snake must avoid them.

4. **Score Management & Leaderboard**  
   - Score increases by 1 for each piece of food eaten.  
   - High scores are saved to a JSON file (`high_scores.json`).

5. **Game Over & Restart**  
   - Game-over screen shows the final score and a leaderboard.  
   - Press **SPACE** on the game-over screen to restart the game.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the Snake Game running on your local machine:

1. **Clone or Download**  
   - **Clone** this repository using:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
     ```  
     or **download** the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**  
   - In your terminal or command prompt, move into the project folder:  
     ```bash
     cd snake-game
     ```

3. **Create/Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional)**  
   - It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts. For example:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
     venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   - This project requires **Python 3.8+** and **Pygame**.
   - Install Pygame (and any other dependencies if needed) using:
     ```bash
     pip install pygame
     ```
     *(If you have a `requirements.txt`, you could instead use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.)*

## Usage

1. **Run the Game**  
   - In the project directory, run the following command:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   
2. **Enjoy the Game**  
   - Use the arrow keys to move the snake.  
   - Press **SPACE** on the main menu to start the game.  
   - Press **ESC** during gameplay to pause (or resume from pause state).  
   - Collect food, avoid obstacles, and watch your snake grow!

3. **View High Scores**  
   - After each game over, the leaderboard (top scores) is displayed.  
   - High scores are stored in `high_scores.json`; it will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

## Project Structure

A brief overview of the key files and their roles in the project:

```
.
├── engine.py        # Main game loop and state management
├── entities.py      # Definitions of Snake, Food, and Obstacles
├── main.py          # Entry point to run the game
├── score.py         # Manages scores and leaderboard
├── settings.py      # Contains constants like screen size, colors, etc.
├── ui.py            # Handles rendering of text and UI elements
├── utils.py         # Utility functions (random positions, collision checks, JSON handling)
└── high_scores.json # Generated at runtime if it doesn't exist (stores leaderboard data)
```

- **engine.py**: Handles the game states (MENU, PLAYING, PAUSED, GAME_OVER) and orchestrates updating/drawing entities.  
- **entities.py**: Contains classes for **Snake**, **Food**, and **Obstacles**.  
- **main.py**: The starting point of the program; it initializes and runs the `GameEngine`.  
- **score.py**: Controls score increment and managing top scores saved to `high_scores.json`.  
- **settings.py**: Centralizes constants like screen width, block size, colors, and enumerations for directions and game states.  
- **ui.py**: Manages the rendering of text (score, menu, game-over screens) to the display.  
- **utils.py**: Helper functions for random position generation, collision detection, and saving/loading high scores.  
- **high_scores.json**: Auto-generated file to store high scores locally.
